# RaplFeedback

***About the Repository***
The File is all about automation test script for creating Feedback in Rapl.
The xpath is described manually as well as using cropath.

***Difficulties faced***
For some web elements there were some clickable exceptions as well as null exceptions, that were handled using some delay ie., for example thread.sleep(2000).
